# MMEA-IDC

This MATLAB code is written by the [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO) framework 4.2.

MMEA-IDC proposes a new perpective in solving ***sparse multi-modal multi-objective*** optimization problems by introducing a large main population for convergence and a small complementary population for diversity, which makes it achieve good performance effectively.

This code is from the paper 'A Size-Imbalanced Dual Population with Complementary Search for Sparse Large-Scale Multi-Modal Multi-Objective Optimization', just accepted in 'IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation'
